# Cineplay

Cineplay is a movie guessing game inspired by the beloved cinemapatti. In this game, players are presented with a series of images related to a movie, and they must guess the movie based on those images. Each game consists of 5 images, and players have to guess the movie within these 5 images. Additionally, there is a leaderboard and movie suggestion system integrated into the game. Only one movie is presented per day to keep the experience fresh and engaging.
